**(Orchestral Fanfare)**

**Announcer:** And in such a fashion the University of Michigan concert band played in Hill Auditorium for the annual Varsity Night Show.

**(Upbeat Jazz/Orchestral Music)**

**Announcer:** Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. From Hill Auditorium on the University of Michigan campus, WUOM takes pleasure in bringing you the 11th annual Varsity Night. This event is held each year on the eve of the final Michigan football game. And tonight, a standing-room-only audience has gathered here in Hill Auditorium to listen to a variety of talent, headed up by the Columbia Broadcasting System's star radio and television comic, Robert Q. Lewis.

**Robert Q. Lewis:** Golly, thanks.
**(Laughter)**
**Lewis:** They say we... we're having some—we’re having a ball down here at Hill Auditorium. If you're home, uh, poring over the books, why, pity on you, man.

**Announcer:** And highlighting the student talent of this swell show was the Vaughn House Trio.

**Vaughn House Trio (Singing):**
From the tables down at Schwaben’s,
To the Bell we love so well,
To the place they serve those famous roots in tea.
Sing the minors all assembled,
With their green beer raised on high,
To the greatest of all universities.
Yes, we’ve cheered our football heroes,
Happy Wistert (Alvin Wistert?) and his boys,
And the bluebook cramming in the Arb was fun.
We can serenade our co-eds,
And the pretty girls as well.

**(Crowd Cheering and Applause)**

**Crowd Chant:**
Michigan! Beat Ohio!
Michigan! Beat Ohio!

**Announcer:** Now, the combined Men's and Women's Glee Clubs summed up our feelings toward each other very aptly.

**(Choral Singing)**
And so we’re offering this simple phrase,
To kids from one to ninety-two.
Although it’s been said, many times, many ways,
Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas,
To you.

**Announcer:** Late hours and black coffee bull sessions indicated the inevitable approach of final exams. But we all took the night off to watch the Michigan basketball team play the Indiana Hoosiers in a game that will be long remembered. After a grueling battle of shots, the score stood tied, 65 all.

**Sportscaster:** Mack Suprunowicz, with 13 seconds to go, takes the ball out of bounds. He throws away out to Morrill. Only eight seconds to go! Morrill trying to shoot. Suprunowicz gets the ball, fakes, shoots the ball—it’s batted out of bounds! Three seconds to go! Suprunowicz will get the ball out, he shoots! Gives the ball to Skala! Skala shoots, it doesn't go in! The rebound is good! The rebound is good! The rebound is scored by Charlie Murray of Michigan as the whistle blew! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the ball game! And one of the most exciting games we have ever seen! Listen to this crowd!

**(Roaring Crowd Noise)**

**Announcer:** And with final exams over at last, the hectic registration week was climaxed by the '50 J-Hop.

**(Big Band Jazz Music Starts)**

**Announcer 2:** Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 1950 J-Hop. This is Bill Fleming speaking to you from the Intramural Building on the University of Michigan campus, where tonight the Broadcasting Service brings you a full hour of musical entertainment featuring the orchestras of Louis Prima and Duke Ellington. We are located at the North Bandstand where, for the first half of the program, we’ll hear music by Louis Prima and his orchestra.

**Announcer 3:** And from the South Bandstand, it’s the music of Duke Ellington and his orchestra.

**(Trumpet and Saxophone)**

**Announcer:** The problem of who can speak on the university campus came to a head again when the Lecture Committee refused to sanction a debate involving Herbert J. Phillips, a self-professed communist. Several days after the ban, a State Street cafeteria was jammed for an off-campus debate between Phillips and Professor Preston Slosson. Two thousand students crowded the streets outside trying to get in.

**Herbert J. Phillips:** I think I need not more than remind you that the center of this attack—shall I say the storm center of this attack—is the organization to which I belong, and have belonged for 14 years: The American Communist Party.

**Announcer:** And then Professor Slosson emphatically declared:

**Professor Preston Slosson:** In which country is it found necessary to forbid people to leave? The United States or Russia? Which country has arrested people and dragged them back for trying to leave the country? Do people try and leave Heaven?

**(Laughter)**

**(Church Bells Ringing)**

**Announcer:** And so, the 1949-50 year passes into time. But who could ever forget the many things that have gone into this year? Our year at Michigan. Listen... and remember.

**(Choir Singing - "I'll Ne'er Forget My College Days")**
I'll ne'er forget my college days,
Those dear sincere old college days.
I'll ne'er forget my Michigan,
'Twas there fond friendships first began (began).
At Michigan all hearts are true,
All loyal to the Maize and Blue.
There e'er will be a golden haze,
Around those dear old college days.

"3">The professors were generally competent in presenting facts. A handful,
in my case a half-dozen or so, demonstrated what to do with facts, how to
think about them. I was lucky to study under skilled practitioners of several
methods-the scientific, the poetic, the historical, the musical, the critical.
They were the men and women who made the University more than a stack of
books.</P>

<P>Professor Herbert<B> </B>Phillips began his opening lecture in Philosophy
1 by pointing to his shirt and asking what we noted. Silence. Broken by
a brave stupid blurting, &quot;It's white.&quot; I sneered, but Dr. Phillips
nodded, held up a sheet of paper. &quot;White.&quot; What was the professor
up to, that the stupid had got and I had not? A piece of blackboard chalk.
A bright cloud out the window. The part of the eye you must see before you
shoot. White, white, white -- <I>whiteness</I>! I walked out on campus into
grassness, under treeness, by squirrelness, studentness. <I>Nessness</I>!
Thus I was introduced to thinking about thinking.</P>

<P>We went together on a five-day hike into wilds of the high Olympics.
Climbing toward a summit, we were confronted by a jungle of slide alder,
and before attempting it sat in the meadow. A cloud of mosquitoes descended.
One settled on Dr. Phillips' forearm, an easy target. Yet he did not kill,
he watched, and so did I. I could not but empathize with her struggle through
the tangle of hair, as daunting as the slide alder, to reach skin, and her
frustration in sinking one dry hole after another, and then her triumph
in hitting a gusher and filling her belly with red, red blood, which smeared
the professor's arm as he concluded the affair with a SPLAT.</P>

<P>Phillips was my only teacher who was fired for teaching.* I can't recall
the language used by President Raymond B. Allen in overruling the faculty
panel of judges; the sense of the verdict echoed that against Socrates in
399 B.C.</P>

<P>In my post-University years, I've pretty well continued to obey my Boy
Scout oath (&quot;On my honor I will do my duty...&quot;) and have done
in (SPLAT) thousands of mosquitoes. Always with empathy, though. Evidence
of how Dr. Phillips corrupted my young mind.<I>-Harvey Manning, '46</I></P>

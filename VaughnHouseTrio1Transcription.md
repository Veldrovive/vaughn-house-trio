To the bells we love so well,
To the place they serve those famous brews and teas.
Sing the minors all assembled,
With their green beer raised on high,
To the greatest of all universities.

Happy Wistert (Alvin Wistert?) and his boys.

I want to go back to Michigan,
To dear Ann Arbor town.
Back to Joe's and the Orient,
Back to some of the money I spent.
I want to go back to Michigan,
To dear Ann Arbor town,
I want to go back, I gotta go back to Michigan.

And we have to figure a hell of a lot to tell what we have done,
With the coin we blew at dear old Michigan.

Oh...

My Michigan...

This is a small collection of documents collected after finding a CD labeled "Vaughn House Trio" at the Salvation Army in Ann Arbor. On the CD were two track:
1. A recording of a parody song sung by the titular Vaughn House Trio around the year 1950.
2. A year in memorandum for the 1949-1950 University of Michigan year.

As far as I can tell the Vaughn House Trio was a musical group affiliated with the "Victor C. Vaughan House", a residence for the University of Michigan ([source](http://milproj.dc.umich.edu/mort/medical/hospitals/Victor%20Vaughn%20House/index.html), [source](https://bentley.umich.edu/legacy-support/campus_tour/victorvaughan.php)).

Collected references:
1. The debate between self-professed communist Herbert J. Phillips who was fired from the University of Washington for being communist and Preston Slosson who was a UofM professor. An image of an article from the April 28th, 1950 Ann Arbor News on the AADLE website is included ([source](https://aadl.org/node/220678)).
2. The "1950 J-Hop" (Junior Hop), a major social event held at the Intramural Building. The recording notes that the event featured two separate bandstands with performances by famous jazz bandleaders Louis Prima and Duke Ellington ([source](https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/j-hops-rise-and-fall/)).
3. A dramatic University of Michigan vs. Indiana Hoosiers basketball game. The audio describes a buzzer-beater finish: a chaotic sequence involving players Suprunowicz and Skala, ending with a game-winning rebound score by Charlie Murray. Michigan won the game 69-67.

4. The "11th Annual Varsity Night" held at Hill Auditorium on the eve of the final football game, hosted by CBS radio and TV comic Robert Q. Lewis.
5. Various historic Ann Arbor locations mentioned in the songs, including "Schwaben's" (Schwaben Halle), "The Bell" (likely the Pretzel Bell), and "The Arb" (Nichols Arboretum) ([Schwaben's](https://aadl.org/aaobserver/15573), [The Bell](https://concentratemedia.com/thepretzelbellannarbor0355/)).
